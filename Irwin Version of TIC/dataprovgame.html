								<h3></h3>
								<p>Data provenance is used in game development to collect data from millions of players' game history in order to create and continuously enhance well-developed games.
								<br>
							  <br>Many online games have these 3 components that are crucial to game development: <br>
								<b>Ranking</b>
								<br>
								Online games like Overwatch, League of Legends, and Call of Duty have their own ranking system that is determined by the amount of wins a player is able to get.
								They collect the data history from the matches that a player competes in to determine the player's rank in the system. Rankings create a competitive thrill and motivates
								players to achieve high status. <br>

                            </center>
								<br>
							  <b>Matchmaking</b>
								<br>
								In order for game matches to be fair yet somewhat challenging, data is collected from individual players in order to have them compete against other players who are
								of equal difficulty. If matchmaking didn't use data provenance, then every game played would be either unfair.

                            </center>
								<br>
								<b>Player Statistics</b>
								<br>
								Data provenance is used to create a player's statistics by gathering the data from their entire game history in order to create upadted statistics that the player can see and use to improve themselves.
								These statistics can include the number of deaths, kills, average win/lost ratio, and many more. This data is also used to determined ranking and matchmaking exlpained above.

                            </center>
								</p>

								<p>
								<b>Data provenance takes an important role in game development.</b>
								It is also used to modify aspects of the game to better the gameplay experience for players, which is why it is important to collect this data to perform updates.
								</p>

									<p>Now we know what data provenance is and how it works in game development! Let's move on to provenance in Overwatch!</p>
